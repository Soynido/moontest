## Observations

### Task Priority Assignment
- Task "Test RL555" elevated to P1 priority
- Rationale: User-requested priority assignment
- Impact: Now aligned with core P1 tasks (diagnostics, logging, E2E tests, etc.)

### System State (Stable)
- No new file changes
- No new terminal events
- No new commits
- System health: stable

## Recommendations

### Next Steps
1. Define scope and acceptance criteria for "Test RL555" task
2. Continue with existing priorities:
   - Review/dismiss 3 off-plan tasks
   - Begin P0 work: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
   - Define metrics for P1 tasks

## Risks

- None (simple priority assignment, no system changes)

## Impact Assessment

- Minimal governance change
- Task now explicitly prioritized at P1 level
- No system performance impact
- No blockers introduced
