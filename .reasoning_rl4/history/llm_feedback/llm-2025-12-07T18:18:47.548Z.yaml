# LLM Feedback — Cycle #8

## Snapshot Summary
- **Phase**: Phase 2 AutoTasks Testing (R1 and canonicalization completed)
- **Mode**: Flexible (P0 + P1 work allowed)
- **Cycle**: #8 (Kernel cycle)
- **Confidence**: 50% (below target, snapshot indicates phase mismatch)

## Changes Applied
1. **Context.RL4**: Updated timestamp, expanded Current Testing Phase with canonicalization test details
2. **Plan.RL4**: Updated to Cycle #8, added canonicalization test progress, adjusted blockers and next actions
3. **Tasks.RL4**: Updated timestamp
4. **ADRs.RL4**: No changes (stable)

## Key Observations
- Phase 2 AutoTasks Testing progressing: R1 heavy modification and canonicalization tests completed
- Canonicalization test added: canonicalize-test.ts with 7 standardization edits (commit 5049046)
- Git Safety Protocol consistently enforced across all commits
- Snapshot confidence at 50% (may indicate kernel state mismatch with actual project progress)
- 51 uncommitted files (RL4 internal state, expected and protected)

## Completed Since Last Snapshot
- Canonicalization test created and committed (5049046)
- Phase 2 testing infrastructure stable (rl4-test-sandbox/)
- Git Safety Protocol validation continued

## Blockers
- Confidence level: 50% (snapshot indicates "Initial Setup" but project is in Phase 2 testing)
- Uncommitted files: 51 (RL4 internal state, protected)
- Phase 2 R2-R10 rules pending execution
- No test execution baseline for moon project

## Next Actions
1. Continue Phase 2 AutoTasks Testing: R2-R10
2. Validate AutoTasks detection in RL4 UI
3. Review snapshot confidence discrepancy
4. Begin P0 work after testing phase
5. Establish test execution baseline

## Risks
- Snapshot confidence mismatch may indicate kernel state desynchronization
- None identified for testing phase

## Ideas Proposed
- None this cycle (focused on testing validation)

## Confidence
- Governance alignment: MEDIUM (0.50 - snapshot indicates phase mismatch)
- System stability: STABLE
- Testing progress: ON TRACK (R1 and canonicalization completed)
