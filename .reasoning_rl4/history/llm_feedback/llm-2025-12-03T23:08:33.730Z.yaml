# LLM Feedback — Cycle #1 (Update)

## Changes Applied

### Context.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-03T23:08:33.730Z
- Mode remains: flexible
- Ground truth established: true

### Tasks.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-03T23:08:33.730Z
- Active tasks: 6 (P0: 1, P1: 3, P2: 2)
- Completed tasks: 1 (Test done-file linking)
- No new tasks added

### Plan.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-03T23:08:33.730Z
- Increased confidence: 0.6 → 0.65 (incremental progress)
- Added "Progress Since Last Snapshot" section documenting completed work
- Added "Current Blockers" section highlighting performance and codec issues
- Expanded "Next Human Actions" with 5 concrete steps

### ADRs.RL4
- No changes (already established with 3 ADRs)

## Observations

### Completed Work Since Last Snapshot
1. Task completed: [P1] Test done-file linking @rl4:id=done-file-test
   - File created: rl4-test-sandbox/done-file.ts
   - Implemented with @rl4:files= annotation
   - 5 edits performed for testing

### System Activity
- File changes: 5 total
  - rl4-test-sandbox/heavy.ts (2 changes - refactor)
  - rl4-test-sandbox/done-file.ts (2 changes - refactor)
  - package.json (1 change - config)
- Git commits: 0 (but git repo initialized with initial commit)
- Terminal events: 0 captured (terminal session tracking not yet operational)
- IDE activity: 0 tracked
- Build metrics: 0

### Off-Plan Work Detected
- 1 off-plan task captured: "Rust Config — package.json"
  - Type: config
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Files: [package.json]
  - Status: Waiting for human to promote or dismiss

### System Health
- Memory: 152MB (healthy, down from 157MB)
- Event loop lag: 0ms (excellent)
- CPU load: 0.00 (idle)
- Cycle performance: ⚠️ DEGRADED
  - Current avg: 871833ms (~14.5 min)
  - Previous avg: 568161ms (~9.5 min)
  - Degradation: +53% slower

### Anomalies & Blockers

#### Critical
- ⚠️ Codec payload exceeds budget
  - Timeline codec in FALLBACK mode
  - 9 cycles recorded but codec cannot process efficiently
  - Impact: Limited historical analysis capability

#### High Priority
- ⚠️ Slow cycles: avg 871833ms (~14.5 min)
  - Significant degradation from previous 9.5 min
  - Root cause investigation required
  - May impact developer experience

#### Medium Priority
- No test execution baseline (diagnostics/tests/latest.json missing)
- Terminal session capture not operational
- Git activity not being tracked properly (0 commits despite git init)

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Cycle #2)
1. **Performance Investigation**: Identify root cause of 53% cycle slowdown
   - Check ledger/WAL file sizes
   - Review timeline event processing
   - Consider codec optimization or pruning
2. **Off-plan Task**: Review and promote/dismiss "Rust Config — package.json"
3. **Test Baseline**: Run initial test suite to populate diagnostics

### Short-term
1. Begin P0 work: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
2. Establish terminal session capture
3. Investigate git tracking (commits not being recorded)
4. Optimize codec to handle larger payloads

### Governance
- Confidence increased minimally (0.6 → 0.65) due to:
  - ✅ 1 task completed successfully
  - ✅ File linking (@rl4:files=) validated
  - ⚠️ Performance degradation
  - ⚠️ Codec issues emerging

## Risks

### Technical
- Cycle performance degradation may worsen with more activity
- Codec fallback limits historical analysis and pattern detection
- Terminal tracking not operational - missing visibility on dev activity
- No test baseline - blind to code quality metrics

### Process
- Off-plan work accumulating (1 task waiting)
- Git activity not being captured properly
- P0 work not yet started (still in setup/validation phase)

## Next Cycle Goals
- Address cycle performance degradation
- Establish test execution baseline
- Begin P0: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
- Fix terminal session capture
- Review off-plan task for promotion/dismissal
