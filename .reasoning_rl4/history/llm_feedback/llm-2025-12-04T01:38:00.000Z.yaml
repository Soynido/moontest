# LLM Feedback — Priority Assignment (Second Task)

## Changes Applied

### Context.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:38:00.000Z
- Mode remains: flexible
- No other changes

### Tasks.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:38:00.000Z
- **Added P1 priority** to task "Test promote RL4" @rl4:id=AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqr32ls
  - Before: `- [ ] Test promote RL4 @rl4:id=AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqr32ls`
  - After: `- [ ] [P1] Test promote RL4 @rl4:id=AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqr32ls`
- Total active tasks: 10 (unchanged)
  - Core tasks: 8 (P0:1, P1:5, P2:2)
  - Autogenerated: 2 (both now P1)

### Plan.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:38:00.000Z
- Confidence remains: 0.75 (no change warranted for simple priority assignment)
- No other changes

### ADRs.RL4
- No changes (3 ADRs remain valid)

## Observations

### Task Priority Assignment
- Task "Test promote RL4" elevated to P1 priority
- Rationale: User-requested priority assignment
- Impact: Both autogenerated tasks now have P1 priority, aligned with core P1 tasks
- **All autogenerated tasks now prioritized**: Both Test RL555 and Test promote RL4 are P1

### System State (Stable)
- No new file changes
- No new terminal events
- No new commits
- System health: stable

## Recommendations

### Next Steps
1. Define scope and acceptance criteria for both autogenerated P1 tasks:
   - "Test RL555" @rl4:id=AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqr31pf
   - "Test promote RL4" @rl4:id=AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqr32ls
2. Continue with existing priorities:
   - Review/dismiss 3 off-plan tasks
   - Begin P0 work: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
   - Define metrics for P1 tasks

## Risks

- None (simple priority assignment, no system changes)

## Impact Assessment

- Minimal governance change
- Both autogenerated tasks now explicitly prioritized at P1 level
- No system performance impact
- No blockers introduced
- Task prioritization complete for autogenerated tasks
