# LLM Feedback — Cycle #13 (Performance Monitoring)

## Changes Applied

### Context.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:39:54.153Z
- Mode remains: flexible
- No other changes

### Tasks.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:39:54.153Z
- No task changes (10 active tasks stable)
- All autogenerated tasks now P1 (completed in previous cycles)

### Plan.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:39:54.153Z
- Confidence remains: 0.75 (stable)
- Updated "Progress Since Last Snapshot" with Cycle #13 metrics
- Updated "Current Blockers" with latest performance data
- Updated "Next Human Actions" with memory monitoring priority

### ADRs.RL4
- No changes (3 ADRs remain valid)

## Observations

### Performance Trends (Positive)
- **Cycle time**: Continued improvement
  - Previous: 1696301ms (~28 min)
  - Current: 1529715ms (~25 min)
  - **Improvement: -11% (3 min faster)**
  - Trend: 60 min → 28 min → 25 min (stable improvement)
- **Memory**: Increased
  - Previous: 144MB
  - Current: 203MB
  - **Change: +59MB (+41%)**
  - Status: Monitoring required (may indicate normal growth or potential issue)

### System Activity (Stable)
- File changes: 8 (no new changes)
- Git commits: 0 (no new commits)
- Terminal events: 2 (stable)
- IDE activity: 0
- Build metrics: 0

### Task Status (Stable)
- Active tasks: 10 (unchanged)
  - Core: 8 (P0:1, P1:5, P2:2)
  - Autogenerated: 2 (both P1)
- Completed: 1 (Test done-file linking)
- Off-plan: 3 (awaiting review, stable)

### Cycle Statistics
- Total cycles: 17
- Current cycle: #13
- Average duration: 1529715ms (~25 min)
- Health: Memory 203MB, Event loop lag 0ms, CPU 0.00

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. **Monitor memory trend**: 203MB is +41% increase from 144MB
   - Check if this is normal growth or potential leak
   - Monitor next cycles for continued growth
   - Consider profiling if trend continues

2. **Continue performance monitoring**: Cycle time improving (25 min avg)
   - Target: Sub-20 min average
   - Current trend is positive

### Short-term
1. Review/dismiss 3 off-plan tasks (stable backlog)
2. Begin P0 work: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
3. Define metrics for P1 objectives
4. Establish test baseline

## Risks

### Low Priority
- Memory increase (+41%) needs monitoring
- Cycle time still above baseline (25 min vs 9.5 min initial)
- Codec payload budget exceeded (stable, not worsening)

### Positive Trends
- ✅ Cycle performance improving consistently
- ✅ System stability maintained (17 cycles)
- ✅ Task prioritization complete
- ✅ No new blockers introduced

## Impact Assessment

- Minimal governance changes (metrics update only)
- Performance trending positive
- Memory increase requires attention but not critical
- System stable and operational

## Next Cycle Goals
- Monitor memory usage (investigate if continues growing)
- Maintain cycle performance improvements
- Clear off-plan task backlog
- Begin P0 work
- Establish test baseline
