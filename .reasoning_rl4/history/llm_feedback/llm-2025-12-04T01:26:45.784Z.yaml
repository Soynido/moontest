# LLM Feedback — Cycle #6 (Task Cleanup)

## Changes Applied

### Context.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:26:45.784Z
- Mode remains: flexible
- Ground truth established: true

### Tasks.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:26:45.784Z
- **Removed task**: "Modif fichier XXLLL" @rl4:id=AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqqzizk
  - Reason: User-requested cleanup
  - Promoted tasks remaining: 2 (Test RL555, Test promote RL4)
- Total active tasks: 10 (was 11)
- Completed tasks: 1 (Test done-file linking)

### Plan.RL4
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-04T01:26:45.784Z
- Increased confidence: 0.7 → 0.75 (task cleanup + performance recovery)
- Updated "Progress Since Last Snapshot" section:
  - Added task cleanup note
  - **Highlighted performance recovery: 60 min → 28 min avg (53% improvement)**
- Updated "Current Blockers":
  - Removed URGENT flag (performance improved)
  - Updated cycle time from 60 min to 28 min
  - Removed "3 local tasks not yet synced" (now synced)
- Updated "Next Human Actions":
  - Removed urgent performance investigation (improved)
  - Removed "Reconcile 3 local tasks" (done)
  - Added monitoring of continued performance

### ADRs.RL4
- No changes (3 ADRs remain valid and applicable)

## Observations

### Task Management
- **Cleanup action**: Removed autogenerated task "Modif fichier XXLLL"
- **Promoted tasks**: 3 local tasks were promoted to governance
  - AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqqzizk (removed this cycle)
  - AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqr31pf (retained)
  - AUTOGENERATED-USER-miqr32ls (retained)
- **Active backlog**: 10 tasks (8 core + 2 autogenerated)

### System Activity (Cycle #6)
- File changes: 8 total (no new changes this cycle)
- Git commits: 0
- Terminal events: 2 (no new events)
- IDE activity: 0
- Build metrics: 0

### Off-Plan Work (Unchanged)
- 3 tasks still awaiting review:
  - Rust Work — rl4-test-sandbox/heavy.ts
  - Rust Work — rl4-test-sandbox/done-file.ts
  - Rust Work — rl4-test-sandbox/utils.ts

### System Health

#### MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: Performance Recovery
- Memory: 144MB (healthy, down from 159MB)
- Event loop lag: 0ms (excellent)
- CPU load: 0.00 (idle)
- Cycle performance: ✅ **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT**
  - Current avg: 1696301ms (~28 min)
  - Previous avg: 3606101ms (~60 min)
  - **Improvement: -53% (2.1x faster)**
  - Status: Still high but no longer critical

#### Performance Analysis
- Cycle #0 → #1: ~9.5 min avg (baseline)
- Cycle #1 → Previous: ~60 min avg (critical degradation, +313%)
- Previous → Current: ~28 min avg (recovery, -53%)
- **Net change from baseline**: +195% (still 2.9x slower than initial)
- **Root cause**: Likely codec payload growth, now stabilizing

### Anomalies & Blockers

#### Medium Priority
- ⚠️ Slow cycles: avg 1696301ms (~28 min)
  - Improved significantly from 60 min
  - Still 2.9x slower than baseline (9.5 min)
  - Trending in right direction
  - Action: Continue monitoring

#### Low Priority (Unchanged)
- Codec payload exceeds budget (timeline codec in fallback mode)
- 3 off-plan tasks awaiting review
- No test execution baseline

#### Resolved
- ✅ Critical performance crisis resolved (60 min → 28 min)
- ✅ Local tasks synced with governance
- ✅ Task cleanup completed

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Cycle #7)
1. **Continue performance monitoring**: Ensure cycle time doesn't regress
   - Current: 28 min avg (acceptable but not optimal)
   - Target: Return to sub-15 min avg
   - Watch for trends

2. **Review off-plan tasks**: 3 tasks still pending
   - heavy.ts, done-file.ts, utils.ts modifications
   - Promote or dismiss to clear backlog

### Short-term
1. Begin P0 work: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
2. Define success metrics for new P1 tasks (logging, E2E tests)
3. Establish test execution baseline
4. Address codec payload budget if performance regresses

### Governance Impact

#### Confidence Progression
- Cycle #1: 0.6 (governance established)
- Previous: 0.7 (objectives clarified, terminal capture operational)
- Current: 0.75 (task cleanup, performance recovery)
- Rationale:
  - ✅ Performance significantly improved
  - ✅ Task management active (cleanup performed)
  - ✅ Local tasks successfully promoted and synced
  - ⚠️ Still above baseline cycle time

#### Task Management
- Total active: 10 (was 11)
  - Core tasks: 8 (P0:1, P1:5, P2:2)
  - Autogenerated: 2 (promoted from local)
- Completed: 1
- Removed: 1 (user-requested cleanup)

## Risks

### Technical (Low)
- Cycle performance improved but still 2.9x slower than baseline
- Codec fallback limits historical analysis
- Performance may regress if not monitored

### Process (Low)
- 3 off-plan tasks still pending review (but not growing)
- P0 work still not started (extended setup phase)

### Positive Trends
- ✅ Performance recovery in progress
- ✅ Task management workflow validated
- ✅ Promotion/cleanup cycle working
- ✅ System stabilizing

## Next Cycle Goals
- Maintain or improve cycle performance (target: sub-20 min)
- Clear off-plan task backlog (promote/dismiss 3 tasks)
- Begin P0: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
- Define metrics for new P1 objectives
- Establish test baseline
