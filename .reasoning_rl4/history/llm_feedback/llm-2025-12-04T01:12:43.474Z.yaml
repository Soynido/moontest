- Increased confidence: 0.6 → 0.7 (new objectives defined, terminal capture operational)
- Added "Progress Since Last Snapshot" section
- Updated "Current Priorities" with 2 new P1 objectives
- Expanded "Current Blockers" with critical performance issue (60 min cycles)
- Updated "Next Human Actions" with 5 prioritized steps (URGENT flag on cycle performance)

### ADRs.RL4
- No changes (3 ADRs remain valid and applicable)

## Observations

### Completed Work Since Last Snapshot
1. Task completed: [P1] Test done-file linking @rl4:id=done-file-test
   - File: rl4-test-sandbox/done-file.ts
   - Validated @rl4:files= annotation linking

### System Activity
- File changes: 8 total
  - rl4-test-sandbox/done-file.ts (3 changes - refactor)
  - rl4-test-sandbox/heavy.ts (2 changes - refactor)
  - rl4-test-sandbox/utils.ts (3 changes - refactor, new file)
  - package.json (1 change - config)
  - rl4-test-sandbox/orphan-zone/my-orphan.ts (1 change - config)
- Git commits: 0
- Terminal events: 2 captured ✅ (terminal capture now operational!)
  - "echo test terminal capture in moon workspace"
  - Generic terminal session activity
- IDE activity: 0 tracked
- Build metrics: 0

### Local Tasks Pending (3)
- "Modif fichier XXLLL" (2025-12-04T00:32:20.197Z)
- "Test RL555" (2025-12-04T00:32:27.031Z)
- "Test promote RL4" (2025-12-04T00:39:07.696Z)

### Off-Plan Work Detected (3)
- Rust Work — rl4-test-sandbox/heavy.ts (UNKNOWN, MEDIUM)
- Rust Work — rl4-test-sandbox/done-file.ts (UNKNOWN, MEDIUM)
- Rust Work — rl4-test-sandbox/utils.ts (UNKNOWN, MEDIUM)

### New Tasks Added (User Requests)
1. **[P1] Improve logging across all Rust crates**
   - Objective: Enhance observability across the codebase
   - Scope: All Rust crates (config, graph, task, action, cache, etc.)
   - Priority: P1 (high importance for production diagnostics)

2. **[P1] Développer tests E2E**
   - Objective: Quality assurance through end-to-end testing
   - Scope: Test full workflows and integration points
   - Priority: P1 (critical for stability guarantees)

### System Health
- Memory: 159MB (healthy, slight increase from 152MB)
- Event loop lag: 0ms (excellent)
- CPU load: 0.00 (idle)
- Cycle performance: ⚠️ **CRITICAL DEGRADATION**
  - Current avg: 3606101ms (~60 min per cycle)
  - Previous avg: 871833ms (~14.5 min)
  - Degradation: **+313% slower** (4.1x slower)
  - This is a critical blocker for developer productivity

### Anomalies & Blockers

#### CRITICAL
- ⚠️ **Slow cycles: avg 3606101ms (~60 min)**
  - Massive performance degradation (+313% from previous snapshot)
  - Root cause investigation required IMMEDIATELY
  - May be related to codec payload issues
  - Impact: Severely impacts developer workflow and RL4 responsiveness

#### High Priority
- ⚠️ Codec payload exceeds budget
  - Timeline codec in FALLBACK mode
  - 5 cycles recorded, growing dataset
  - Action: Prune old events or optimize codec

#### Medium Priority
- 3 local tasks pending promotion/dismissal
- 3 off-plan tasks awaiting review
- No test execution baseline (diagnostics/tests/latest.json missing)

#### Positive Developments
- ✅ Terminal capture now operational (2 sessions recorded)
- ✅ Terminal events file created and populated
- ✅ File change tracking working correctly (8 changes detected)

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE (URGENT - Cycle #2)
1. **Performance Crisis**: Investigate 60-min cycle avg
   - Check ledger/WAL file sizes (may have grown excessively)
   - Review timeline event processing (24 events detected)
   - Consider aggressive pruning of old events
   - Profile kernel performance
   - **This is blocking all other work**

2. **Cleanup Pending Work**:
   - Review and promote/dismiss 3 off-plan tasks
   - Reconcile 3 local tasks with governance

### Short-term
1. Begin P0 work: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
2. Define success criteria for new P1 tasks:
   - Logging improvement: metrics, coverage, format
   - E2E tests: scope, coverage targets, CI integration
3. Establish test execution baseline

### Medium-term
1. Address codec payload budget issue
2. Implement cycle performance monitoring/alerts
3. Document terminal capture feature (now operational)

## Governance Impact

### Confidence Progression
- Cycle #0 → #1: 0.4 → 0.6 (+0.2, governance established)
- Cycle #1 → Current: 0.6 → 0.7 (+0.1, objectives clarified)
- Rationale:
  - ✅ Terminal capture operational
  - ✅ New objectives defined (logging, E2E tests)
  - ✅ File tracking working correctly
  - ⚠️ Performance crisis partially offsets gains

### Task Expansion
- Total tasks increased: 6 → 8 (+2 P1 tasks)
- Work backlog growing (3 local + 3 off-plan tasks pending)
- P1 priority area expanding (quality + observability focus)

## Risks

### Technical (Critical)
- Cycle performance degradation may worsen exponentially
- Codec fallback limits historical analysis
- Large backlog of unreviewed work (6 tasks pending review)
- Performance issues may indicate deeper systemic problems

### Process
- Off-plan work accumulating faster than review capacity
- Local tasks not being synced with governance
- P0 work still not started (setup/validation phase extended)

## Next Cycle Goals
- **#1 Priority**: Resolve cycle performance crisis
- Cleanup pending work (promote/dismiss 6 tasks)
- Begin P0: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
- Define metrics for new P1 objectives
- Establish test baseline
