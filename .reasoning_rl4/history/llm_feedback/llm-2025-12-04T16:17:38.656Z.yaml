# LLM Feedback — Cycle #1

## Snapshot Summary
- **Phase**: Phase 2 AutoTasks Testing (R1 Heavy Modification Detection)
- **Mode**: Flexible (P0 + P1 work allowed)
- **Cycle**: #1 of 27 total cycles

## Changes Applied
1. **Context.RL4**: Updated with current testing phase (Phase 2 R1 AutoTasks)
2. **Plan.RL4**: Updated progress, removed memory creep blocker (improved to 150MB), added R1 completion
3. **Tasks.RL4**: Updated timestamp
4. **ADRs.RL4**: Added ADR-004 for RL4 Git Safety Protocol validation

## Key Observations
- R1 Heavy Modification Detection test completed successfully (15+ edits to heavy.ts)
- RL4 Git Safety Protocol validated: Agent correctly refused to commit internal files
- Clean git commit 7dcd7ec with sandbox code only (no RL4 internal files leaked)
- Memory usage improved: 150MB (down from 211MB peak)
- 2 off-plan tasks detected in .cursor/rules and root folder

## Completed Since Last Snapshot
- Phase 2 R1 testing infrastructure created (rl4-test-sandbox/)
- Heavy modification test executed (15+ rapid edits)
- Git Safety Protocol enforcement validated
- ADR-004 documented

## Blockers
- Codec payload exceeds budget (stable, in fallback mode)
- Slow cycles: ~25 min avg (stable but above target)
- No test execution baseline established
- 2 off-plan tasks awaiting review

## Next Actions
1. Continue Phase 2 AutoTasks Testing: R2-R10
2. Review and promote/dismiss 2 off-plan tasks
3. Monitor cycle performance
4. Validate AutoTasks detection in RL4 UI
5. Begin P0 work after testing phase

## Risks
- None identified this cycle

## Ideas Proposed
- None this cycle (focused on testing validation)

## Confidence
- Governance alignment: HIGH (0.82)
- System stability: STABLE
- Testing progress: ON TRACK
