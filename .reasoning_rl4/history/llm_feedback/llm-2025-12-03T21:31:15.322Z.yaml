# LLM Feedback — Cycle #1

## Changes Applied

### Context.RL4
- Updated mode: strict → flexible
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-03T21:31:15.322Z

### Tasks.RL4
- Cleaned up malformed TODO entries extracted from documentation
- Reordered tasks by priority (P0 first)
- Added Completed section (currently empty)
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-03T21:31:15.322Z

### Plan.RL4
- Increased confidence: 0.4 → 0.6 (governance structure now established)
- Replaced "Immediate Actions Proposed" with "Current Priorities (Cycle #1)" reflecting actual P0/P1/P2 backlog
- Added "Next Human Actions" section with concrete next steps
- Updated timestamp to 2025-12-03T21:31:15.322Z

### ADRs.RL4
- Added ADR-001: Zones critiques protégées (config, graph, proto/WASM)
- Added ADR-002: Migration legacy progressive (pas de big bang)
- Added ADR-003: Tests verts obligatoires avant merge

## Observations

### System Health
- Memory: 157MB (healthy)
- Event loop lag: 0ms (healthy)
- CPU load: 0.00 (healthy)

### Anomalies Detected
- Slow cycles: average 568161ms (~9.5 minutes per cycle)
- Codec blocked: timeline_insufficient (<3 valid ledger events after filtering)
- No test execution detected (diagnostics/tests/latest.json missing)

### Activity Summary (Cycle #1)
- File changes: 2 (both in rl4-test-sandbox/heavy.ts — refactoring)
- Git commits: 0
- Terminal events: 0
- Active tasks: 0 (baseline reconstruction phase)

## Recommendations

### Immediate
1. Validate P0 task prioritization with technical dependencies
2. Define success metrics for "Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching"
3. Document legacy migration strategy (timeline, risks, rollback)

### Short-term
1. Establish baseline test execution to populate diagnostics/tests/latest.json
2. Add more ledger events to enable RBLE codec (currently in fallback mode)
3. Investigate slow cycle performance (avg ~9.5 min)

### Governance
- Mode flexible correctly set for P0 + P1 work
- ADRs established for critical zones (config, graph, proto/WASM)
- Task list cleaned and prioritized
- Confidence increased from 0.4 to 0.6 (governance baseline established)

## Risks
- Timeline codec insufficient: limited historical analysis capability
- No test diagnostics: blind to test coverage/failures
- Slow cycles: may impact developer experience
- Legacy migration not yet scoped: timeline/risks undefined

## Next Cycle Goals
- Begin P0 work: Stabilisation toolchain/graph/caching
- Populate test diagnostics
- Accelerate cycle performance
- Define legacy migration roadmap
